# km-scripts
Personal scripts that make my [Knox Makers](https://knoxmakers.org) job a bit easier

##### haxdb-cli
Command line interface for our makerspace's member directory - https://github.com/haxdb

##### mattermost_vote_bot
Our makerspace votes on each candidate for full membership after a 30 day trial.  This reads the member database every day to see if anyone's trial is up, then posts to the Board of Directors' private Mattermost Channel to call for a vote.
